## Simple Trading Simulator

This repository models a simple trading exchange and trading clients. There are a total of two Stocks that the clients can either buy or sell. Currently the implemented algorithm only executes a trade if there is an exact match for its order. That is, there is no partial order fulfilment.

All the code in this repository is written in Java and has been tested with openjdk version 1.8.0.


Future Work:
1. Make each Client a separate thread
2. Add partial order fulfilment
